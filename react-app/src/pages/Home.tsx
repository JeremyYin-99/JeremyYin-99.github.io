        <p className="About-Me-Content">
          After graduating with a Bachelor's and Master's of Science in Civil
          Environmental Engineering under my belt, I've spent years delving into
          the intricacies of infrastructure design, construction, and
          management. My academic journey has instilled in me a deep
          appreciation for the intersection of theory and practice, which fuels
          my enthusiasm for tackling real-world challenges.
        </p>
        <p className="About-Me-Content">
          Beyond the realms of traditional engineering, I harbor a fervent
          passion for machine learning and data science. My fascination with
          these fields stems from their potential to revolutionize how we
          approach problem-solving and decision-making in the built environment.
        </p>
        <p className="About-Me-Content">
          I thrive on the thrill of building thingsâ€”whether it's physical
          structures or algorithmic models. From conceptualization to execution,
          I relish the opportunity to bring ideas to life and witness their
          tangible impact on the world around us.
        </p>
        <p className="About-Me-Content">
          Academic research has been a cornerstone of my journey, providing me
          with invaluable insights and opportunities for growth. Through
          rigorous experimentation and analysis, I've contributed to advancing
          knowledge in areas ranging from fault detection in structural systems
          to optimization and simulation techniques.
