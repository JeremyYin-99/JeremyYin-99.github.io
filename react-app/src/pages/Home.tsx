        <p className="About-Me-Content">
          Beyond the traditional realms of engineering, I am deeply fascinated
          by the potential of machine learning and data science to transform
          problem-solving and decision-making processes within the built
          environment. I find great satisfaction in the engineering, creativity,
          and design processes, whether they involve the physical construction
          and modeling or the development of algorithmic models.
