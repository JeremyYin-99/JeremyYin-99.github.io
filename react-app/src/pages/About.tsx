      <p className="About-Me-Content">
        Having earned both a Bachelor's and Master's of Science in Civil
        Environmental Engineering, I've dedicated years to exploring
        infrastructure design, construction, and management. My academic journey
        has left me with a deep appreciation for combining theoretical knowledge
        and practical application, driving my passion for utilizing novel
        techniques to address real-world challenges.
      </p>
      <p className="About-Me-Content">
        Beyond the traditional realms of civil engineering, I am interested in
        the potential of machine learning and data science to transform
        problem-solving and decision-making processes within the built
        environment. I am passionate about engineering, creativity design, and
        software development, whether they involve the physical construction and
        modeling or the development of algorithmic models and solutions.
